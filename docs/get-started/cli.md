# SR Linux CLI

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://viewer.diagrams.net/js/viewer-static.min.js" async></script>

Over the past years the industry has seen numerous attempts to sacrifice the CLI to the SDN and/or automation gods. We believe that CLI is here to stay, and we must evolve it and make it powerful, modern, programmable, and highly customizable.

With the ambitious goal of making SR Linux CLI the pinnacle of the text-based interfaces, we knew it would look different from the traditional CLI. But fear not, the powers that come with SR Linux CLI outweigh the little effort it takes to make your fingers memorize new commands.

/// admonition | Highly customizable CLI
    type: subtle-note
SR Linux CLI is highly customizable, you can change the prompt, add new commands, create aliases, etc. If you miss a feature - join our [Discord community](https://go.srlinux.dev/discord) and let us know!
///

## Prompt

The first thing you will see when logged into SR Linux is its default two-line prompt and a CLI status toolbar.

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/srlinux-getting-started/main/diagrams/get-started.drawio', title='Default SR Linux prompt', page=0) }}-

The prompt' picture title reads "default", because it is highly customizable. For the purpose of this guide, we will use the default prompt and leave prompt customization for later. The annotations in the picture provide a brief explanation of each part of the prompt, and we provide a more detailed through the rest of this guide.

## Help

When you first log into an unknown OS, you want to know what commands are available to you. In SR Linux, there are several context-aware help commands and key bindings that can help you navigate the CLI.

Hitting the <kbd>?</kbd> in the CLI will list all available **local** commands:
<!-- --8<-- [start:local-in-running] -->
```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# <pressed ? key>
Local commands:
  acl               Top level container for configuration and operational state related to access control lists (ACLs)
  bfd               Context to configure BFD parameters and report BFD sessions state
  interface         The list of named interfaces on the device
  network-instance  Network instances configured on the local system
  platform          Enclosing container for platform components
  qos               Top-level container for QoS data
  routing-policy    Top-level container for all routing policy configuration
  system            Enclosing container for system management
  tunnel            This model collects all config and state aspects of the tunnel table
  tunnel-interface  In the case that the interface is logical tunnel

*** Not all commands are listed, press '?' again to see all options ***
```
<!-- --8<-- [end:local-in-running] -->

Local commands are actual configuration elements available in the present working context. See this `[  ]` in the prompt? That means the user is in root context, and local commands that are available in the `running` mode for the root context are listed.

If you press <kbd>?</kbd> again, you will see all available commands, local and global:

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# <pressed ? key> <pressed ? key again>
Local commands:
  acl               Top level container for configuration and operational state related to access control lists (ACLs)
  bfd               Context to configure BFD parameters and report BFD sessions state
 # clipped
  tunnel-interface  In the case that the interface is logical tunnel

Global commands:
  !                 History substitution
  /                 Moves you to the root
  back              Return to previous context
  bash              Open bash session
# clipped
  environment       Control the look-and-feel of the CLI
```

Global commands, as the name implies, are available in any context. They are not tied to a specific context.

### Suggestions and completions

Something that you will notice when hitting <kbd>TAB</kbd> is the auto-suggestion form that is common in powerful shells like zsh/fish but was not available in any other NOS CLI until now.

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/srlinux-getting-started/main/diagrams/get-started.drawio', title='', page=1) }}-

The suggestion popup shows global and local commands available in the current context. In other words, it is context aware.  
Since we are still sitting in the root context (`[  ]` indicates that), the suggestion popup shows all available commands in the root context.

You can use the arrow keys (<kbd><-</kbd><kbd>-></kbd>, etc) to navigate the suggestions and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to select a suggestion.

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/srlinux-getting-started/main/diagrams/get-started.drawio', title='', page=2) }}-

Besides the suggestions, SR Linux comes with the smart autocompletion system. Again, something that modern shells offer you on *nix systems. When you start typing a command, the CLI will suggest the next command right in the command line using the same context-aware suggestions.

And if you are a fast typer, autocompletion engine will try to fix typos for you whenever it can.

## CLI modes

SR Linux CLI has three main modes that a user can be in:

* running
* candidate (aka configuration)
* state

### Running

When a user logs into SR Linux, they start in the `running` mode. This is the mode in which the user can use operational and show commands, view configuration and perform actions via `/tools` commands, but they **can not** perform any configuration changes.

/// admonition | Similar to...
    type: subtle-note
This mode is similar to the enable mode (in Cisco/Arista) or the operational mode (Juniper Junos). The prompt and the toolbar show `running` when the user is in this mode.
///

As said, in this mode a user can execute operational and show commands. To give you a few examples:

/// tab | `ping`

```srl
Ping is an operational command.

--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# ping network-instance mgmt 172.20.20.1
Using network instance mgmt
PING 172.20.20.1 (172.20.20.1) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 172.20.20.1: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=5.59 ms
64 bytes from 172.20.20.1: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=1.26 ms
```

///
/// tab | `show version`

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# show version
--------------------------------------------------
Hostname             : leaf1
Chassis Type         : 7220 IXR-D2L
Part Number          : Sim Part No.

System HW MAC Address: 1A:29:02:FF:00:00
Software Version     : v23.10.1

Free Memory          : 59331625 kB
--------------------------------------------------
```

///

### Candidate

The `candidate` mode is the mode in which a user performs configuration changes in the candidate datastore. To enter this mode use the `enter` global command and provide the mode as an argument.

```srl title="Enter candidate mode from running mode"
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# enter candidate

--{ candidate shared default }--[  ]--
A:leaf1#
```

You can immediately notice how the prompt changed. Now it shows the following information:

* `candidate` - the mode in which the user is in
* `shared` - the type of the candidate datastore is shared[^1]
* `default` - the name of the candidate datastore

We will show you how to perform configuration changes when we get to the [Interfaces](interface.md) section.

### State

The last mode we are going to meet is the `state` mode. This mode is similar to the `running` mode as the user can view configuration, execute operational and show commands.  
But in addition to that, the user can also view the **state** information, that is the values that are non-configurable, but are calculated by the system.

Think about counters, like interface statistics, or the system uptime, or BGP peering state. These are state information and these values are accessible in the `state` mode.

```srl title="Enter candidate mode from running mode"
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# enter state

--{ state }--[  ]--
A:leaf1#
```

/// admonition | Changing between CLI modes
    type: subtle-note
Typing `enter <target-mode>` anywhere in the CLI will change the current mode to the target mode.
///

## Navigation and Contexts

Upon logging into SR Linux, you start in the root context, as indicated by the `[  ]` part of prompt. Using the CLI [help](#help) commands, you can explore what commands and contexts are available to you from your current context.

/// admonition | SR Linux is a fully modelled Network OS
    type: subtle-note
Since SR Linux Network OS operates on a 100% YANG-modelled infrastructure, its CLI strictly follows the YANG model and the [YANG model](../yang/index.md) is a tree-like hierarchical structure.
///

As shown in the Help section before, you can list the local commands available in the current context using <kbd>?</kbd> key. For example, in the root context of the running mode you get the following:

--8<-- "docs/get-started/cli.md:local-in-running"

### Entering contexts

What you see in the list of the local commands are **contexts** that you can enter by typing the name of the context. For example, if you want to enter the `interface` context, you can do so by typing `interface`:

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/srlinux-getting-started/main/diagrams/get-started.drawio', title='', page=3) }}-

If you click <kbd>TAB</kbd> or <kbd>Space</kbd> after typing `interface` the CLI will prompt you with the `<name>` key, indicating that the `interface` is a list element and you need to provide the interface name as an argument.

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/srlinux-getting-started/main/diagrams/get-started.drawio', title='', page=4) }}-

Clicking <kbd>TAB</kbd> again will show you the configured interfaces present in the system in the autosuggestion window:

-{{ diagram(url='srl-labs/srlinux-getting-started/main/diagrams/get-started.drawio', title='', page=5) }}-

Let's select `mgmt0` or type it in and press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to enter the `interface mgmt0` context.

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# interface mgmt0

--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1#
```

The prompt changed to show the current context - `[ interface mgmt0 ]`. Recall, that SR Linux CLI is context-aware, therefore using the <kbd>?</kbd> key now will show you the different local commands, as you are standing in a different current context.

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# <pressed ? key>
Local commands:
  admin-state*      The configured, desired state of the interface
  description*      A user-configured description of the interface
  ethernet
  lag               Container for options related to LAG
  loopback-mode*    Loopback mode of the port
  mtu*              Port MTU in bytes including ethernet overhead but excluding 4-bytes FCS
  qos
  sflow             Context to configure sFlow parameters
  subinterface      The list of subinterfaces (logical interfaces) associated with a physical interface
  tpid*             Optionally set the tag protocol identifier field (TPID) that
  transceiver
  vlan-tagging*     When set to true the interface is allowed to accept frames with one or more VLAN tags
```

You're again present with a list of local commands, but this time you can spot an asterisk (`*`) next to some of the commands. These are the stub contexts (leafs and leaf-lists) that you can not enter to.

Let's go one level deeper by entering into the `subinterface` context of our `mgmt0` interface.

By typing `subinterface` and pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> you will see autosuggested subinterface index `0` automatically selected. This is because `mgmt0` interface has only one subinterface configured and it is `0`[^2]. By clicking <kbd>TAB</kbd> after again you will accept the suggestion and hitting <kbd>Enter</kbd> will enter the `subinterface 0` context.

```srl title="Accept suggested subinterface index with TAB key"
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# subinterface 0
```

Now the prompt changed to show the current context - `[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]`.

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1#
```

### Exiting contexts

To exit from the current context use `exit` command, that takes an optional argument of `to`. Consider the following example where we are in the `interface mgmt0 subinterface 0` context and we want to exit one step above to the `interface mgmt0` context.

```srl title="<code>exit</code> brings you one level up in the context hierarchy"
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1# exit

--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1#
```

If you want to exit to a specific parent context from the current one, you can leverage `exit to` variant:

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1# exit to <context>
                  interface
                  root     
```

The autosuggestion window will list all parent contexts (`interface`, `root`) that you can exit to from your current context.

And lastly, you can also navigate to whatever context from any other context by providing the absolute path to the target context. The absolute path starts with `/`. The example below will switch the context from `interface mgmt0 subinterface 0` to `system information`.

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1# / system information

--{ running }--[ system information ]--
A:leaf1#
```

### Command scope

When you're in a context, your commands are scoped to that context. For example, if we are currently sitting in the `[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]` context, then the `tree` command that prints the tree of available child elements will start from our present context:

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1# tree
subinterface
+-- type
+-- description
+-- admin-state
+-- ip-mtu
+-- l2-mtu
+-- ipv4
|  +-- admin-state
# clipped
```

If you want to change the context of a given command you provide the context as an argument. Using the same `tree` command we can list the available child elements of the `system information` context by providing the absolute path to the target context:

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1# tree /system information
information
+-- contact
+-- location
```

Even `show` commands that we will explore later are context-aware. For example, within our `[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]` context, the `show version` command that every NOS has will yield the error:

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1# show version
Parsing error: Unknown token 'version'.
Options are ['#', '..', '/', '>', '>>', 'all', 'brief', 'detail', 'queue-detail', '|', '}']
```

And that is because in the current context there is no `version` command that `show` can execute. The `version` show report belongs to the root context, so to successfully execute it we need to be in the root context, or provide the fully-qualified-context-path:

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 subinterface 0 ]--
A:leaf1# show / version
-----------------------------------------------------
Hostname             : leaf1
Chassis Type         : 7220 IXR-D2L
Part Number          : Sim Part No.
Serial Number        : Sim Serial No.
# clipped
```

## `info` command

The `info` command is your swiss army knife when you are in the CLI jungles. You would use it to get both configuration and state information available on the SR Linux device. Let's see how it works.

While we are in the running mode, lets go once again to the `mgmt0` interface context:

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# interface mgmt0

--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1#
```

Now let's run the `info` command:

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# info
    admin-state enable
    subinterface 0 {
        admin-state enable
        ip-mtu 1500
        ipv4 {
            admin-state enable
            dhcp-client {
            }
        }
        ipv6 {
            admin-state enable
            dhcp-client {
            }
        }
    }
```

Look at that, we just listed the running configuration of the `mgmt0` interface.  
Which brings us to the conclusion #1: In _running_ CLI mode, the `info` command shows the running configuration of the current context.

What happens, if we switch to the `state` mode right from the `interface mgmt0` context and run the `info` command there?

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# enter state

--{ state }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# info
    admin-state enable
    mtu 1514
    ifindex 1077952510
    oper-state up
    last-change "2024-09-25T14:28:40.810Z (21 hours ago)"
    statistics {
        in-packets 622
        in-octets 63571
        in-unicast-packets 231
        in-broadcast-packets 36
        in-multicast-packets 141
        in-discarded-packets 211
        in-error-packets 3
        in-fcs-error-packets 0
# clipped
    }
    sflow {
        admin-state disable
    }
```

Nice, way more information, and that is because the `info` command returns state elements of the current context (and its children) when executed in the `state` CLI mode.

/// admonition | SR Linux State = configuration + state
    type: tip
It is important to remember, that unlike SR OS, in SR Linux the state contains both configuration and state values. Hence when you execute the `info` command in the `state` CLI mode, you will see configuration values such as `admin-state` and `mtu` and also state values such as `oper-state`, and `statistics`.
///

### from

Even though `info` behaves differently depending on the CLI mode, you don't need to always switch the CLI mode, as the `info` command can take it as an argument. For example, here is how we can list the configuration of the `mgmt0` interface without leaving the `state` mode:

```srl
--{ state }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# info from running
    admin-state enable
    subinterface 0 {
        admin-state enable
        ip-mtu 1500
        ipv4 {
            admin-state enable
            dhcp-client {
            }
        }
        ipv6 {
            admin-state enable
            dhcp-client {
            }
        }
    }
```

### depth

There was a lot of information when we ran `info` while in the `state` mode. If we want to limit the depth of the output, we can use the `depth` argument. For example, if we want to see only the state the immediate children elements of the `mgmt0` interface, we can use the `depth` argument with a value of 1:

```srl
--{ state }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# info depth 1
    admin-state enable
    mtu 1514
    ifindex 1077952510
    oper-state up
    last-change "2024-09-25T14:28:40.810Z (21 hours ago)"
    statistics {
        in-packets 775
        in-octets 77949
        in-unicast-packets 375
        in-broadcast-packets 36
        in-multicast-packets 142
        in-discarded-packets 219
        in-error-packets 3
        in-fcs-error-packets 0
        out-packets 449
        out-octets 77452
        out-mirror-octets 0
        out-unicast-packets 397
        out-broadcast-packets 6
        out-multicast-packets 46
        out-discarded-packets 0
        out-error-packets 0
        out-mirror-packets 0
        carrier-transitions 1
    }
    traffic-rate {
        in-bps 1466
        out-bps 1400
    }
    ethernet {
        port-speed 1G
        hw-mac-address 02:42:AC:14:14:03
    }
    subinterface 0 {
        admin-state enable
        ip-mtu 1500
        name mgmt0.0
        ifindex 1077936129
        oper-state up
        last-change "2024-09-25T14:28:40.810Z (21 hours ago)"
    }
    sflow {
        admin-state disable
    }
```

### with context

Another useful argument to the `info` command is context argument that is the last element of the command. It allows you to specify the context from which you want to retrieve the information. It would be not cool to first ask you to move in a certain context to retrieve the information from.

Thus, you can simply provide the target context as the last argument to the `info` command. And you can combine it with the `from` and `depth` arguments as well.

```srl
--{ state }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# info from running /system banner
    system {
        banner {
            login-banner "................................................................

        }
    }
```

## Output modifiers

Output modifiers allow you to process the output of the commands (such as `info` output) and modify it. They should be provided after the command and after the pipe - <kbd>|</kbd> - key.

### more

Inspired by the Linux, SR Linux does not paginate the output by default. Instead, a user should apply the `| more` modifier if they wish to paginate the output.

Can be useful when you want to see the large output of the `info` or `show` command in a single screen:

```srl
--{ state }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# info | more
    admin-state enable
    mtu 1514
    ifindex 1077952510
    oper-state up
    last-change "2024-09-25T14:28:40.810Z (21 hours ago)"
    statistics {
        in-packets 983
        in-octets 98381
        in-unicast-packets 582
        in-broadcast-packets 36
        in-multicast-packets 142
        in-discarded-packets 220
        in-error-packets 3
        in-fcs-error-packets 0
        out-packets 598
        out-octets 107162
        out-mirror-octets 0
        out-unicast-packets 546
        out-broadcast-packets 6
        out-multicast-packets 46
        out-discarded-packets 0
        out-error-packets 0
        out-mirror-packets 0
--More--
```

The output will stop filling up the available height of the terminal, waiting for a user to press on of the following:

* <kbd>Enter</kbd> - to advance a line
* <kbd>Space</kbd> - to advance a page
* <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> - to close the paginator

### as

Another important modifier is the `as` modifier that allows you to transform the output to a different format:

* yaml
* json
* table

It is primarily used with the `info` output. For example, if you want to convert the configuration of a certain context to the YAML or JSON format, you can use the `as` modifier:

/// tab | JSON

### grep/head/tail/wc

Of course, you can use the common Linux utilities like `grep`, `head`, `tail` and `wc`. We leverage the underlying Debian 12 Linux distribution where these utilities are available.

### jq and yq

We have also baked in the powerful `jq` and `yq` tools to the SR Linux CLI so that you can transform, query, and modify the output of the `info` command and create your own custom outputs.

## Show commands

It is hard to imagine a Network CLI without the `show` command. When the `info` command outputs the raw, most details config or state of a particular context, effectively dumping the whole datastore, the `show` command produces the output that is meant to be more human-readable. Like a table output with information potentially pulled from different contexts.

SR Linux comes with a good number of `show` commands, some of them we [documented in the CLI section](../cli/show-commands/index.md) of this portal. A `show` command is essentially a small CLI program that talks to SR Linux management core and parses the output into a desired format.

Naturally, the first command you execute on a system is the `show version` command. But mind that the `show` command is context-aware, so if you're in the context other than the root, you will have to specify the context:

```srl
--{ running }--[ interface mgmt0 ]--
A:leaf1# show /version
--------------------------------------------------
Hostname             : leaf1
Chassis Type         : 7220 IXR-D2L
Part Number          : Sim Part No.
Serial Number        : Sim Serial No.
System HW MAC Address: 1A:7C:02:FF:00:00
OS                   : SR Linux
Software Version     : v24.7.2

Total Memory         : 72379371 kB
Free Memory          : 48025562 kB
--------------------------------------------------
```

SR Linux show commands follow the same schema as the contexts follow. This makes the mental map of SR Linux schema much easier, as you can use the `show` command in front of the path that you used to enter the context.

Let's look at the example where we use the `show interface` command:

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# show interface mgmt0
===========================================================================================================================================
mgmt0 is up, speed 1G, type None
  mgmt0.0 is up
    Network-instances:
      * Name: mgmt (ip-vrf)
    Encapsulation   : null
    Type            : None
    IPv4 addr    : 172.20.20.3/24 (dhcp, preferred)
    IPv6 addr    : 2001:172:20:20::3/64 (dhcp, preferred)
    IPv6 addr    : fe80::42:acff:fe14:1403/64 (link-layer, preferred)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
=============================================================================
```

Note, how after the `show` command we provide the context in the same way as we would use to enter into the interface context. The same schema applies to the `show` command.

Another, more elaborated example is showing the `bgp` summary of the management network instance:

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# show network-instance mgmt protocols bgp summary
```

It doesn't yield any output, since we don't have any BGP sessions configured, but it is a good example of how the show command follows the same schema, because to enter into the bgp context for configuration we would type the following:

```srl
--{ running }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# enter candidate

--{ candidate shared default }--[  ]--
A:leaf1# network-instance mgmt protocols bgp

--{ * candidate shared default }--[ network-instance mgmt protocols bgp ]--
A:leaf1#
```

_Konsequent, praktisch, gut._

Now you have a good primer on the SR Linux CLI and ready to start using it to configure, monitor, and troubleshoot your network.
