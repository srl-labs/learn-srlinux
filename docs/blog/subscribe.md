## RSS

This blog publishes two RSS feeds:

- `https://learn.srlinux.dev/feed_rss_created.xml` - feed is updated whenever a new post is created.
- `https://learn.srlinux.dev/feed_rss_updated.xml` - feed is updated whenever a new post is **created or updated**.

## Email

You can get notifications in your mailbox by channeling the RSS feed using one of the RSS-to-Email services.

A popular option is a free [blogtrottr](https://blogtrottr.com/) service, but if it doesn't suit you, there are alternatives like feedrabbit and IFTT.

In blogtrottr, all you need to do is to enter `https://learn.srlinux.dev` in the site input field, type in your email and select the "Realtime" delivery option. Then select which feed you want to receive (see [rss section](#rss) for an explanation).
