## NDK Admin state

Release 25.3.1 changes the default enablement state of the NDK server and introduces the `system ndk-server admin-state` leaf to control the server's status. From Release 25.3.1 onwards, the NDK server is disabled by default.

If a system that has NDK applications is upgraded from a previous release, the NDK server is kept enabled to ensure seamless operation.

## Defining Linux capabilities for the NDK agents

From Release 25.3.1 onwards, a user may specify the Linux capability set that will be granted to the NDK application. When an app needs to perform privileged operations, it may set the capability set instead of running with `sudo` privileges.

A user may specify the capability bounding set as a list of capability keys (without the `CAP_` prefix) as a list under the `capability-bounding-set` key in the [application YAML file](../guide/agent.md#application-manager-and-application-configuration-file).

## NDK proto messages harmonization

Release 25.3.1 aligns the majority of the NDK proto messages and fields in them to the protobuf style guide as outlined in the protobuf specification. This alignment may require NDK developers to rename the methods and field accessors accordingly.
